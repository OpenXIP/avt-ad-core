Welcome to the AVT Annotation Database Core&trade; Project!
===========================================================

The Algorithm Validation Toolkit&trade; (AVT&trade;) Open Source project is a set
of tools that facilitate the testing and statistical comparison of image processing
algorithms.  It is built upon the
[eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;)](http://www.OpenXIP.org) development
framework, and can create and consume objects based
on [AIM (Annotation and Image Markup] (https://github.com/NCIP/annotation-and-image-markup)
models.  

The Annotation Database Core&trade; component of AVT&trade; provides an
implementation of the [AD API&trade;](https://github.com/OpenXIP/avt-ad-api)
Interface, and is utilized at run time by other AVT components and the
[XIP Host&trade;](https://github.com/OpenXIP/xip-host) to access the Annotation Database.
AD Core&trade; is implemented in Java, and uses the free distribution of the
[IBM DB2 Express-C](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express-c/download.html)
product as its backend database.

The ultimate goal of the project is to provide an implementation of the AD API.
